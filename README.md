# Brown Bag Speech

So I gotta bring three objects that are able to fit within a brown bag (Like one from kings). I've gotta describe all three objects what they mean to me.

So here's how I can start off my speech. I can describe how when we were tasked with the assignment, I wanted to look deeper and see what the stories behind them were. 

**The Three Objects:**
- [x] SD Card - Cameras and photography has been my hobby throughout my teenage years
- [x] Dumbbell - Working out has changed habits and built who I am
- [x] CPU - Technology has shaped my personality

**This isn't a word for word thing I will say. However it will be a little close, while remaining in the time frame.**

"When we were tasked with this assignment, I knew this was a chance to visually show the key components that have built the person who I am."

"The three objects I've brought all have a very similar relationship, but all have very different stories from me, along with the people who were next to me to witness it."

"The first item that's really built my teenage years would be this SD card. I've gone through tens of these, collecting countless footage from sports games with my friends running a media club in high school. It has all the memories of the best moments shot on camera and I always carry one on me just in case I need one."

"The second item that would describe me would be this dumbbell. In middle school I used to struggle a lot getting my work done and staying on task, however when high school came around the corner, I was put into a weight lifting class which drastically changed who I am. I've improved a lot of habits that I had and its completed revived the ability of who I can potentially be."

"Now the last and final object that would describe me would be this. It's called a Central Processing Unit or CPU. Now I put this in my choices of three because I try to think logically how a computer would. Whether its a set of instructions and executing in parallel, or just working at a faster rate. It's also a big interest of mine, I'm always messing around with hardware, fixing computers, coding and spectating on my parents fine work with this same innovation."

"So while these items might look obsolete to some, they can have a deeper meaning for everyone. And I give you guys hope to try to find that deeper meaning for yourself."
